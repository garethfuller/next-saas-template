# Next SaaS Template

My very bare bones Nextjs (13) SaaS template. By filling out the .env.template
file and renaming .env you should have a fully functional SaaS app with email
authentication via Next-auth/Postmark and Stripe subscriptions.

Initial implementation drawn from
[taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy).

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
